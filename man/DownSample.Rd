\title{This function DownSample selects representative cells from clusters within a Palette object, either in a supervised manner (using known group labels from metadata) or unsupervised (using pre-computed clusters), optionally leveraging dimensionality reduction (PCA, LSI or SVD) and silhouette-based filtering.}
\usage{
DownSample(
  object,
  modal = NULL,
  sample = NULL,
  supervised = TRUE,
  group = NULL,
  dim.reduce = TRUE,
  dims = list(1:50),
  method = c("PCA", "LSI", "SVD"),
  joint = FALSE,
  quantile.cutoff = 0.75,
  min.cell = 20
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A Palette object containing assay data, clustering results, and metadata.}

\item{modal}{Modalities to include (e.g., RNA, ATAC, ADT).}

\item{sample}{Specific sample(s) to include from the object.}

\item{supervised}{Logical; whether to perform supervised downsampling using predefined groups.}

\item{group}{Metadata column name specifying labels for supervised sampling.}

\item{dim.reduce}{Logical; whether to perform sampling in reduced-dimensional space.}

\item{dims}{Dimensions to use for representation (can be a list per modality).}

\item{method}{Dimensionality reduction method; "PCA" for RNA/ADT, "LSI" or "SVD" for ATAC.}

\item{joint}{Logical; whether to compute clustering in a shared reduced space across modalities.}

\item{quantile.cutoff}{Quantile threshold for selecting top-scoring representative cells within clusters.}

\item{min.cell}{Minimum number of representative cells to retain per cluster.}
}
