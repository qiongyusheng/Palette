\title{Compute embeddings for isolated modalities}
\usage{
IsolatedModalEmbedding(
  object,
  modal = NULL,
  method = "PCA",
  dims = NULL,
  do.scale = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A data object containing assay and feature information.}

\item{modal}{Character vector specifying modalities to process;
defaults to isolated modalities detected in the object.}

\item{method}{Character vector indicating the dimensionality reduction
method to use (e.g., \code{"PCA"}, \code{"SVD"}, \code{"LSI"}).}

\item{dims}{List of integer vectors specifying which dimensions to retain
for each modality.}

\item{do.scale}{Logical value (or vector) indicating whether to apply scaling
before dimensionality reduction.}
}
\value{
The updated object with embeddings stored in each selected assay.
}
\description{
This function generates low-dimensional embeddings for isolated modalities
using dimensionality reduction methods such as PCA, SVD, or LSI.
