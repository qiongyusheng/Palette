\title{This function performs singular value decomposition (SVD) across multiple matrices to generate a shared low-dimensional representation and projections.}
\usage{
Run_Multi_SVD_s(x, n.dims = 50, thresh = 10000L)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A list of matrices to be jointly decomposed.}

\item{n.dims}{Number of singular vectors (dimensions) to retain.}

\item{thresh}{Row-size threshold that determines whether covariance-based SVD or concatenated-matrix SVD is applied.}
}
