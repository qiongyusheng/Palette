\title{Run fastMNN integration for multiple batches}
\usage{
run_fastMNN(
  batches,
  cell_name,
  is.normalize = TRUE,
  method = "LogNormalize",
  nfeatures = NULL,
  vargs = NULL,
  k = 20,

}
\arguments{
\item{batches}{A list of expression matrices, each representing a batch.}

\item{cell_name}{A character vector of cell names corresponding to all cells across batches.}

\item{is.normalize}{Logical, whether to normalize data before integration.}

\item{method}{Normalization method. Options include 'LogNormalize', 'CLR', or 'TF-IDF'.}

\item{nfeatures}{Number of features to use for variable feature selection (currently unused, can be NULL).}

\item{vargs}{Optional variable genes to use (currently unused, can be NULL).}

\item{k}{Number of nearest neighbors for the fastMNN algorithm.}

\item{out.npcs}{Number of principal components to compute in the output embedding.}
}
\value{
A matrix of integrated low-dimensional embeddings with cells as columns and dimensions as rows.
}
\description{
This function integrates multiple single-cell batches using the fastMNN algorithm
and returns a low-dimensional representation for all cells.
